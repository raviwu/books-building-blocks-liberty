&lt;p&gt;Whenever one says “I own a house,” what one normally means is: I have the right to determine how that particular resource—described in objective, physical terms—is to be employed; I am free to employ it for any purpose whatsoever, provided that in so doing I do not impair the physical integrity of resources owned by others; I am likewise entitled to expect that the physical integrity of my resource, my house, remains unaffected by the actions others perform with the physical resources at their disposal. Property rights, then, are commonly conceived of as extending to specific, physical objects. These objects are economic goods and hence have value, otherwise no one would claim them. Yet it is not to the value attached to a specific resource that property rights extend, but rather exclusively to the physical integrity of such a good. I do not own the value of my house. I own a physically specified house, and I have the right to expect that others will not physically damage it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>2 Toward a Universal Libertarian Theory of Weapon Control</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-02-toward-a-universal-theory-of-gun-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-02-toward-a-universal-theory-of-gun-control/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="2-toward-a-universal-libertarian-theory-of-gun-weapon-control-a-spatial-and-geographical-analysis"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No rational person can doubt that chemists must pick their way through an ethical minefield. The Nazi ovens owed their properties and attributes to members of this profession, directly or indirectly. Nor can it be denied that biologists are often faced with moral quandaries; genetic cloning and germ warfare spring readily to mind in this context. The same goes for doctors (Dr. Mengele and Dr. Kevorkian are cases in point),&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; veterinarians (just ask People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and physicists (the bomb).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>3 Environmentalism and Economic Freedom</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-03-environmentalism-and-economic-freedom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-03-environmentalism-and-economic-freedom/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="3-environmentalism-and-economic-freedom-the-case-for-private-property-rights"&gt;
 3 Environmentalism and Economic Freedom: The Case for Private Property Rights
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#3-environmentalism-and-economic-freedom-the-case-for-private-property-rights"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper shall attempt to reconcile environmentalism and economic freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before making this seemingly quixotic endeavor, we must be sure we are clear on both concepts. Environmentalism may be noncontroversially defined as a philosophy which sees great benefit in clean air and water, and to a lowered rate of species extinction. Environmentalists are particularly concerned with the survival and enhancement of endangered species such as trees, elephants, rhinos and whales, and with noise and dust pollution, oil spills, greenhouse effects and the dissipation of the ozone layer. Note, this version of environmentalism is a very moderate one. Moreover, it is purely goal directed. It implies no means to these ends whatsoever. In this perspective, environmentalism is, in principle, as much compatible with free enterprise as it is with its polar opposite, centralized governmental command and control.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>4 Enterprising Education</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-04-enterprising-education/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-04-enterprising-education/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="4-enterprising-education-doing-away-with-the-public-school-system"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides national defense, no government-provided service enjoys as much exemption from scrutiny as the provision and subsidization of primary public education. Even presumed champions of the free market, such as Milton Friedman, support the government subsidization of education through high school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have always been proud, and with good reason, of the widespread availability of schooling to all and the role that public schooling has played in fostering the assimilation of newcomers into our society, preventing fragmentation and divisiveness, and enabling people from different cultural and religious backgrounds to live together in harmony.

&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to document the fact that many segments of our society extol the virtues of unionism, as commonly practiced. Some people defend unions as a means of promoting employment. Others feel that “social justice” is a sufficient warrant for this curious institution. So deeply embedded in our folkways is the concept that unions are legitimate institutions that many mainline religious organizations have even gone so far as to invite them to organize their own church employees—on what they see as moral grounds. The simple fact is that in the minds of most pundits, unions have a legitimate role to play in our society. How else can we account for the fact that gangs of organized laborers who have engaged in violent strikes not only still remain at large, but are widely applauded for their courage and convictions? Were any other group of people to have interfered with the lives and property of others in a similar manner, they would have been summarily clapped into jail, and been considered proper objects of fear, loathing, ridicule and pity, the reaction elicited in most people by activities criminal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>6 Is There a Right To Unionize?</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-06-is-there-a-right-to-unionize/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-06-is-there-a-right-to-unionize/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="6-is-there-a-right-to-unionize"&gt;
 6 Is There a Right To Unionize?
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#6-is-there-a-right-to-unionize"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resist the notion that we have a “right to unionize” or that unionization is akin, or, worse, an implication of, the right to freely associate. Yes, theoretically, a labor organization could limit itself to organizing a mass quit unless they got what they wanted. That would indeed be an implication of the law of free association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every union with which I am familiar reserves the right to employ violence (that is, to initiate violence) against competing workers, e.g., scabs, whether in a “blue collar way” by beating them up, or in a “white collar way” by getting laws passed compelling employers to deal with them, and not with the scabs. (Does anyone know of a counterexample to this? If you know of any, I’d be glad to hear of it. I once thought I had found one: The Christian Labor Association of Canada. But based on an interview with them I can say that while they eschew “blue collar” aggression, they support the “white collar” version).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>7 Free Market Transportation</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-07-free-market-transportation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-07-free-market-transportation/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="7-free-market-transportation-denationalizing-the-roads"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were a government to demand the sacrifice of 46,700 citizens&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; each year, there is no doubt that an outraged public would revolt. If an organized religion were to plan the immolation of 523,335 of the faithful in a decade,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; there is no question that it would be toppled. Were there a Manson-type cult that murdered 790 people to celebrate Memorial Day, 770 to usher in the Fourth of July, 915 to commemorate Labor Day, 960 at Thanksgiving, and solemnized Christmas with 355 more deaths,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; surely The New York Times would wax eloquent about the carnage, calling for the greatest manhunt this nation has ever seen. If Dr. Spock were to learn of a disease that killed 2,077 children&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; under the age of five each year, or were New York City’s Andrew Stein to uncover a nursing home that allowed 7,346 elderly people to die annually,&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; there would be no stone unturned in their efforts to combat the enemy. To compound the horror, were private enterprise responsible for this butchery, a cataclysmic reaction would ensue: investigation panels would be appointed, the justice department would seek out antitrust violations, company executives would be jailed, and an outraged hue and cry for nationalization would follow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>8 Public Goods and Externalities</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-08-public-goods-and-externalities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-08-public-goods-and-externalities/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="8-public-goods-and-externalities-the-case-of-roads"&gt;
 8 Public Goods and Externalities: The Case of Roads
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#8-public-goods-and-externalities-the-case-of-roads"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When government monopolization of the roadways is discussed by economists, the “externalities” argument is usually raised. The argument is said to be simple, clear, and irrefutable. In fact, none of these terms really apply. Let us consider the argument closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The externalities argument is based upon a distinction between private goods and services, the use of which benefits only the consumer in question, and public or collective goods, consumption of which necessarily affects the welfare of third or “external” parties. For example, externalities are said to exist when Mr. A paints his house and neighboring householders benefit as a result.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Housepainting is contrasted with completely private goods such as bread, which adds to the well-being of only those who purchase and consume it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>9 The Gold Standard</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-09-the-gold-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-09-the-gold-standard/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="9-the-gold-standard-a-critique-of-friedman-mundell-hayek-and-greenspan-from-the-free-enterprise-perspective"&gt;
 9 The Gold Standard: A Critique of Friedman, Mundell, Hayek and Greenspan from the Free Enterprise Perspective

&lt;p&gt;This is an essay which takes as its jumping off point the free enterprise system. It then attempts to evaluate the contributions of four distinguished scholars to monetary theory in general, and to an evaluation of the gold standard in particular. I take for granted the general case for markets, competition, economic freedom.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The four individuals mentioned in the title have been chosen because they are widely believed to be exemplars of this limited government, free market, political philosophy—and are also opponents of the gold standard. It is one of the purposes of the present contribution to test that very proposition. To wit, it is an attempt to see how consistent with their otherwise expressed principles of free enterprise are their contributions to monetary theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
