&lt;p>Murray Rothbard, in his life, was known as Mr. Libertarian. We can make a solid case that the title now belongs to Walter Block, a student of Rothbard’s whose own vita is as thick as a phone book, as diverse as Wikipedia. Whether he is writing on economic theory, ethics, political secession, drugs, roads, education, monetary policy, social theory, unions, political language, or anything else, his prose burns with a passion for this single idea: if human problems are to be solved, the solution is to be found by permitting greater liberty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/03-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/03-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">

&lt;p>This book Building Blocks for Liberty: Critical Essays by Walter Block is dedicated to the notion that libertarianism is not only a political economic philosophy that is powerful and insightful, but it is also unique; it is neither of the right nor of the left (Walter Block, “Libertarianism is Unique; It Belongs Neither to the Right Nor the Left; A Critique of the Views of Long, Holcombe, and Baden on the left, Hoppe, Feser and Paul on the right,” Journal of Libertarian Studies, 2010).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>1 On Property and Exploitation</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-01-on-property-and-exploitation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-01-on-property-and-exploitation/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="1-on-property-and-exploitation">

&lt;p>Whenever one says “I own a house,” what one normally means is: I have the right to determine how that particular resource—described in objective, physical terms—is to be employed; I am free to employ it for any purpose whatsoever, provided that in so doing I do not impair the physical integrity of resources owned by others; I am likewise entitled to expect that the physical integrity of my resource, my house, remains unaffected by the actions others perform with the physical resources at their disposal. Property rights, then, are commonly conceived of as extending to specific, physical objects. These objects are economic goods and hence have value, otherwise no one would claim them. Yet it is not to the value attached to a specific resource that property rights extend, but rather exclusively to the physical integrity of such a good. I do not own the value of my house. I own a physically specified house, and I have the right to expect that others will not physically damage it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2 Toward a Universal Libertarian Theory of Weapon Control</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-02-toward-a-universal-theory-of-gun-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-02-toward-a-universal-theory-of-gun-control/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="2-toward-a-universal-libertarian-theory-of-gun-weapon-control-a-spatial-and-geographical-analysis">

&lt;p>No rational person can doubt that chemists must pick their way through an ethical minefield. The Nazi ovens owed their properties and attributes to members of this profession, directly or indirectly.

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This paper shall attempt to reconcile environmentalism and economic freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before making this seemingly quixotic endeavor, we must be sure we are clear on both concepts. Environmentalism may be noncontroversially defined as a philosophy which sees great benefit in clean air and water, and to a lowered rate of species extinction. Environmentalists are particularly concerned with the survival and enhancement of endangered species such as trees, elephants, rhinos and whales, and with noise and dust pollution, oil spills, greenhouse effects and the dissipation of the ozone layer. Note, this version of environmentalism is a very moderate one. Moreover, it is purely goal directed. It implies no means to these ends whatsoever. In this perspective, environmentalism is, in principle, as much compatible with free enterprise as it is with its polar opposite, centralized governmental command and control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>4 Enterprising Education</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-04-enterprising-education/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-04-enterprising-education/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="4-enterprising-education-doing-away-with-the-public-school-system">

&lt;p>Besides national defense, no government-provided service enjoys as much exemption from scrutiny as the provision and subsidization of primary public education. Even presumed champions of the free market, such as Milton Friedman, support the government subsidization of education through high school:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We have always been proud, and with good reason, of the widespread availability of schooling to all and the role that public schooling has played in fostering the assimilation of newcomers into our society, preventing fragmentation and divisiveness, and enabling people from different cultural and religious backgrounds to live together in harmony.

&lt;p>It is not difficult to document the fact that many segments of our society extol the virtues of unionism, as commonly practiced. Some people defend unions as a means of promoting employment. Others feel that “social justice” is a sufficient warrant for this curious institution. So deeply embedded in our folkways is the concept that unions are legitimate institutions that many mainline religious organizations have even gone so far as to invite them to organize their own church employees—on what they see as moral grounds. The simple fact is that in the minds of most pundits, unions have a legitimate role to play in our society. How else can we account for the fact that gangs of organized laborers who have engaged in violent strikes not only still remain at large, but are widely applauded for their courage and convictions? Were any other group of people to have interfered with the lives and property of others in a similar manner, they would have been summarily clapped into jail, and been considered proper objects of fear, loathing, ridicule and pity, the reaction elicited in most people by activities criminal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>6 Is There a Right To Unionize?</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-06-is-there-a-right-to-unionize/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-06-is-there-a-right-to-unionize/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="6-is-there-a-right-to-unionize">
 6 Is There a Right To Unionize?

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I resist the notion that we have a “right to unionize” or that unionization is akin, or, worse, an implication of, the right to freely associate. Yes, theoretically, a labor organization could limit itself to organizing a mass quit unless they got what they wanted. That would indeed be an implication of the law of free association.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But every union with which I am familiar reserves the right to employ violence (that is, to initiate violence) against competing workers, e.g., scabs, whether in a “blue collar way” by beating them up, or in a “white collar way” by getting laws passed compelling employers to deal with them, and not with the scabs. (Does anyone know of a counterexample to this? If you know of any, I’d be glad to hear of it. I once thought I had found one: The Christian Labor Association of Canada. But based on an interview with them I can say that while they eschew “blue collar” aggression, they support the “white collar” version).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>7 Free Market Transportation</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-07-free-market-transportation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-07-free-market-transportation/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="7-free-market-transportation-denationalizing-the-roads">

 8 Public Goods and Externalities: The Case of Roads
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#8-public-goods-and-externalities-the-case-of-roads">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When government monopolization of the roadways is discussed by economists, the “externalities” argument is usually raised. The argument is said to be simple, clear, and irrefutable. In fact, none of these terms really apply. Let us consider the argument closely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The externalities argument is based upon a distinction between private goods and services, the use of which benefits only the consumer in question, and public or collective goods, consumption of which necessarily affects the welfare of third or “external” parties. For example, externalities are said to exist when Mr. A paints his house and neighboring householders benefit as a result.1 Housepainting is contrasted with completely private goods such as bread, which adds to the well-being of only those who purchase and consume it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>9 The Gold Standard</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-09-the-gold-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-1-economics/part-1-09-the-gold-standard/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="9-the-gold-standard-a-critique-of-friedman-mundell-hayek-and-greenspan-from-the-free-enterprise-perspective">

&lt;p>This is an essay which takes as its jumping off point the free enterprise system. It then attempts to evaluate the contributions of four distinguished scholars to monetary theory in general, and to an evaluation of the gold standard in particular. I take for granted the general case for markets, competition, economic freedom.1 The four individuals mentioned in the title have been chosen because they are widely believed to be exemplars of this limited government, free market, political philosophy—and are also opponents of the gold standard. It is one of the purposes of the present contribution to test that very proposition. To wit, it is an attempt to see how consistent with their otherwise expressed principles of free enterprise are their contributions to monetary theory.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>10 The Nonaggression Axiom of Libertarianism</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-10-the-nonaggression-axiom-of-libertarianism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-10-the-nonaggression-axiom-of-libertarianism/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="10-the-nonaggression-axiom-of-libertarianism">

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The nonaggression axiom is the lynchpin of the philosophy of libertarianism. It states, simply, that it shall be legal for anyone to do anything he wants, provided only that he not initiate (or threaten) violence against the person or legitimately owned property of another. That is, in the free society, one has the right to manufacture, buy or sell any good or service at any mutually agreeable terms. Thus, there would be no victimless crime prohibitions, price controls, government regulation of the economy, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>11 Libertarianism, Positive Obligations and Property Abandonment</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-11-libertarianism-positive-obligations-and-property-abandonment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-11-libertarianism-positive-obligations-and-property-abandonment/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="11-libertarianism-positive-obligations-and-property-abandonment-childrens-rights">

&lt;p>A basic premise of libertarianism (Cuzán 1979; de Jasay 1985, 1997; Friedman 1978; Hoppe 1989; Hummel 1990; Kinsella 1996a; Morriss 1998; Rothbard 1978, 1982; Skoble 1995; Sechrest 1999; Stringham 1998; Tinsley 1998) is that there are no positive obligations. No one is forced to contribute to charity. Good Samaritan laws mandating that people come to the aid of those in trouble (say, an unconscious person) are incompatible with libertarianism. To take an extreme case, there would be no law against refusing to toss a life preserver to a drowning man even if one could do so with minimal effort, and his death would occur otherwise. In this political philosophy, there are only negative obligations.1 It is prohibited, and a punishable criminal offense, to initiate or even threaten violence against anyone or his justly acquired property.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>12 Social Justice</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-12-social-justice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-12-social-justice/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="12-social-justice">

 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#12-social-justice">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>On many university campuses, there is a push on to promote social justice. There are two ways to define “social justice.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, this concept may be defined substantively. Here, it is typically associated with left-wing or socialist analyses, policies and prescriptions. For example, poverty is caused by unbridled capitalism; the solution is to heavily regulate markets, or ban them outright. Racism and sexism account for the relative plight of racial minorities and women; laws should be passed prohibiting their exercise. Greater reliance on government is required as the solution of all sorts of social problems. The planet is in great danger from environmental despoliation, due to an unjustified reliance on private property rights. Taxes are too low; they should be raised. Charity is an insult to the poor, who must obtain more revenues by right, not condescension. Diversity is the sine qua non of the fair society. Discrimination is one of the greatest evils to have ever beset mankind. Use of terminology such as “mankind” is sexist, and constitutes hate speech.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>13 Discrimination</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-13-discrimination/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-13-discrimination/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="13-discrimination-an-interdisciplinary-analysis">

 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#13-discrimination-an-interdisciplinary-analysis">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Discrimination has been treated by large parts of the academic community as though it were not amenable to logical analysis, be it economic, ethical or political; as though the very consideration of alternative viewpoints were somehow unsavory. The philosophy of “feminism,” “human rights,” “multiculturalism,” and “political correctness” have so permeated intellectual discussion that criticisms of the mainstream view take on an aura of illegitimacy at the outset, even before arguments are heard in their behalf. This is highly unfortunate. If nothing else, John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty should give us pause before closing our minds to alternative perspectives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>14 A Libertarian Case for Free Immigration</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-14-a-libertarian-case-for-free-immigration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-14-a-libertarian-case-for-free-immigration/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="14-a-libertarian-case-for-free-immigration">

&lt;p>The law of free association is a crucially important implication of the rights of private property (in physical material, and in our own bodies). For if we cannot freely associate with others on a mutually-voluntary basis, our property rights are to that extent abrogated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most serious denigration of property rights in persons and thus in free association is, of course, murder. No one favors such behavior (killing in self-defense is entirely another matter) so this is not at all controversial. Another grave violation of the libertarian code of nonaggression against nonaggressors and their property is slavery (or kidnapping, which is short-term slavery). This, too, is nondebatable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>16 Legalize Drugs Now!</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-16-legalize-drugs-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-16-legalize-drugs-now/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="16-legalize-drugs-now-an-analysis-of-the-benefits-of-legalized-drugs">

&lt;p>Many argue that drug prohibition protects addicts from themselves by exerting parental control over their behavior. This government-enforced control, the anti-drug laws, strictly monitors addicts treatment of their own bodies. For example, the government decides that it wants to protect Fred Brown from destroying his body. The government, therefore, outlaws narcotics and, in effect, takes control of Fred’s body. Under the United States Constitution and the anti-slavery laws, this hegemony should not happen. The guiding principles of the United States, iterated both in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, protect Fred’s basic civil liberties to “pursue his own happiness” as long as he doesn’t infringe on others’ rights to life and property. With prohibition, Fred no longer has this constitutional right. He no longer controls his own body. Regulation has stripped him of his civil liberty. Fred’s role of “owner of his own body” is taken away from him. This has, in effect, made him a slave.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>17 Libertarianism and Libertinism</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-17-libertarianism-and-libertinism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-2-human-rights/part-2-17-libertarianism-and-libertinism/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="17-libertarianism-and-libertinism">
 17 Libertarianism and Libertinism

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>There is perhaps no greater confusion in all of political economy than that between libertarianism and libertinism. That they are commonly taken for one another is an understatement of the highest order. For several reasons, it is difficult to compare and contrast libertarianism and libertinism. First and most important, on some issues the two views do closely resemble one another, at least superficially. Second—perhaps purely by accident, perhaps due to etymological considerations—the two words not only sound alike, but are spelled almost identically. It is all the more important, then, to distinguish between the very different concepts these words represent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>18 Watch Your Language</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-18-watch-your-language/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-18-watch-your-language/</guid><description>&lt;p>18 Watch Your Language&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Language is crucial to clear communication. It makes distinctions. We can hardly express ourselves without it. Our very thoughts can either be brought forth, or not, depending upon whether we have sufficient verbiage with which to attain this end. If the pen is mightier than the sword because it can determine the direction in which this weapon is aimed, then words are even mightier than the pen, for without the former the latter is useless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>19 Taking Back the Language</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-19-taking-back-the-language/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-19-taking-back-the-language/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="19-taking-back-the-language">

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In my last column,1 I claimed that language was important in the ideological battle for the free society. If we allow our “friends” on the statist left to seize the linguistic high ground, we make the battle more difficult for ourselves. We must use words which help us make the case for laissez faire capitalism, not those insisted upon by the other side. Let us now continue this process of “deconstructing” language to these ends with some more examples.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>20 Word Watch</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-20-word-watch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-20-word-watch/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="20-word-watch">

&lt;p>Stakeholder&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A new word has crept into our lexicon, courtesy of our friends on the left. It is “stakeholder” and it is the entering wedge of yet another attack on private property rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the good old days, a firm had contractual obligations to its suppliers, to its employees, and to its customers. The only obligation it had to its neighbors was the one we all have to each other: to refrain from threatening or engaging in initiatory violence against them and their rightfully owned property.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>21 Continuing to Watch Our Language</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-21-continuing-to-watch-our-language/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-21-continuing-to-watch-our-language/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="21-continuing-to-watch-our-language">

&lt;p>In past columns on Watching Your Language,1 I made the point that it is important for us who espouse the freedom philosophy to be aware of the importance of language. If we get pushed into the linguistic corner our intellectual enemies have prepared for us, it is even more difficult to make the case in favor of laissez faire capitalism. In these previous attempts to wrestle with this challenge, I tried to set the record straight with regard to the following words and phrases: Ms., developing countries, rent-seeking, social justice, tax subsidies, property rights, filthy rich, privileged, unearned income, freeman, ultra, profiteer, book burning, stakeholder, getting something for nothing, free rider, swamps and prejudice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>22 Voluntary Taxes</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-22-voluntary-taxes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-22-voluntary-taxes/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="22-voluntary-taxes-abusive-language-and-politicians">

&lt;p>(with William Barnett)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In his March 20, 2002 letter to the Wall Street Journal “‘Tough-Guy’ Proposals for Indiana’s Budget,” that state’s Governor Frank O’Bannon calls “for increases in two minor, voluntary taxes—on cigarettes and riverboat admissions.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Voluntary taxation?” “Voluntary taxation” is an oxymoron if ever there was one; it is similar to “jumbo shrimp,” “an important trifle,” or “a square circle.” “Voluntary taxation” is a downright contradiction in terms, since if there is anything that taxation is not, it is voluntary. The proof is, if you do not pay, your property is forcibly confiscated and/or you go to jail. “Coercive taxation” is a redundancy, because once you comprehend the former word in this phrase, you know the meaning of the latter is a constituent part of that understanding.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>23 Language, Once Again: Civil War, Inclusive Language, Economic Warfare, National Wealth</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-23-language-once-again/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/part-3-language/part-3-23-language-once-again/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="23-language-once-again-civil-war-inclusive-language-economic-warfare-national-wealth">

&lt;p>Civil War&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What took place in 1861 in the U.S. was not a “civil war.” There were not two contending armies, each one trying to rule the other. Rather, this was a war over secession.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For an example of a true civil war we might consider the Spanish Civil War of 1936. There, two groups fought each other, and each wished to rule over the entire country. On the one side were the fascists, under Franco; on the other side were the communists.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bibliography</title><link>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/04-bibliography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raviwu.github.io/books-building-blocks-liberty/en/docs/04-bibliography/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="bibliography">
